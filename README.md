#It is my discretion to be transparent and to provide a thoughtful reason why I wanted to put this project in the repository. I think you will
find that, many of us want to make each other's lives a little easier and to this end, I produced a video store app program. The program uses 
C# and I like this language of programming. I think visual studio is very engaging and challenging as well...for the backend programming.
Visual studio code I wanted to make use of for the frontend. However, I chose to only display my visual studio programming. I just was fooling around
with C# and .NET and I wish to be cautious about how much work and struggle that I put into a program; and I struggled this time. Here's to us
having a great time here on Github. I also want to post my activites with the API testing. POSTMAN was what I used to test my API. I got a little Javascript, from my POST and GET actions, which I considered a frontend milestone and the script is here: <script crossorigin="anonymous" defer="defer" type="application/javascript"
